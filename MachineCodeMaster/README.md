# BASIC source code for `Mastercode`

## Intro

This directory has the source code, written in BASIC, for a Commodore 64 assembler.  This was typed in from the book "Commodore 64 Machine Code Master" written by David Lawrence & Mark England.  It was published in 1984 by Sunshine Books in London.  I found this book on eBay and noticed it was only being offered by UK & Australian sellers.  I ended up getting my copy from Australia.

This book presents a full development environment, but since it is written in BASIC it is fairly slow.

It provides:
 - Mastercode Monitor
 - Mastercode Disassembler
 - Mastercode File Editor
 - Mastercode Assembler
