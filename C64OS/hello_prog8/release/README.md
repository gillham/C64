# App installer

Copy `HelloProg8v0.car` to your C64 OS media, boot C64 OS and double-click on it in File Manager.

This CAR file is of the Install type which means it will extract into your system directory.
That is typically `os` for most people. So this CAR file has "applications/Hello Prog8/" with
the files in it.  This means you can put the CAR file on a D64 image or pretty much any
other media the you can access from C64 OS File Manager.  Double-clicking should launch the Installer
Utility and you can click install.

NOTE: The Installer Utility exits C64 OS when the installation is complete.
So just fire it back up.  It didn't crash.  Then run `Hello Prog8` from Applications.
