# C64 OS "includes" for Prog8

These were generated from [the official OpCoders, Inc release]
(https://github.com/OpCoders-Inc/c64os-dev) of SDK / headers.

This is not a copy, but probably qualifies as 'substantial portions'
even though it is just definitions not actually code.  Anyway the original
OpCoders, Inc license is included as LICENSE.
